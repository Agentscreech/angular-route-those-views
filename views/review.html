    <p>We’ve been here before. We’ve stared down the barrel of a twin-striped Mustang with more than 500 horsepower and the name of a Texas chicken farmer across its fanny. The last one, the 2013 Shelby GT500, had 662 horsepower, in fact, and was said to
      go over 200 mph. It didn’t, not for us, anyway. Even so, it was what a Shelby Mustang should be, what it has been for decades: a hot quarter-mile with a side of smoky burnout. It was a muscle car with more. Mustang lovers got sweaty, but as usual,
      the rest of the auto world just shrugged and moved on with evolution. Ford says it’s different this time. It says the new Shelby GT350, a name positively gestational with history, is a light-year leap in sophistication and handling. It says the
      flat-plane-crank V-8 delivers 8000 revelations per minute, that the magnetic suspension and custom, cross-drilled brake system and Michelin superstick tires prove that the company is serious about achieving world-class handling. Well, Ford says
      a lot of things. Our natural skepticism, honed to a katana’s twinkle by years of Shelbys with skull-rattling rides and plodding dynamics, marched proudly into the cockpit of the new GT350—whereupon it died instantly on the car’s red start button.
      Vaa-ROOOOOMpapapapapapa!!!! Oh. Maybe they’re serious this time.
    </p>

    <p>With the six-speed slotted into gear and the surprisingly light clutch lifted, the GT350 leapt onto the asphalt of Monterey’s Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. First corner and first impressions: tight, tied-down, stable, maybe a little bit of push but,
      hey, the car’s cold and a bit heavy. Wind it out—wait, where’s the redline? Nowhere. It doesn’t exist! The sucker just keeps straining, keeps revving, keeps swelling with a glorious brassy, unmuffled, rhapsodic roar. The anticipated upshift was
      forgotten as another corner approached. The brakes—oof, such brakes!—chomp down, but the nose doesn’t dive. The car isn’t crossed up or squirming, it’s flat and stable and ready to turn right now! Less understeer this time, a perfect arc scribed
      from the white line to apex to white line. And it’s on the gas again, the sound flooding back—that addictive, dazzling, erotic exhale of lyric fire. Yes. Yes, indeed. Ford is serious. With the $49,995 GT350 and the even more track-ratty $63,495
      GT350R, Ford wants to quit the pony-car sphere that the Mustang has inhabited since 1964. Supposedly using Carroll Shelby’s original race-ready Shelby GT350 as its guiding Polaris, the engineers set out to build a no-excuses track machine, more
      multitalented than the GT500 blunderbuss it replaces. That car was all about muscle power and 200 mph. This one is a little lighter, a lot more lithe, and perhaps able to finally get the attention of non-muscle-car types. You say you have a BMW
      but want something different, possibly American-made, but a Corvette isn’t your thing and a Camaro Z/28 is too brutish? Ford wants to talk to you.
    </p>

    <p>Not that the new Shelby isn’t quick, but it’s not a dedicated quarter-mile eater, either. The base GT350 reaches 60 mph in 4.3 seconds after a somewhat difficult launch and does the quarter-mile in 12.5 seconds at 117 mph. Perhaps not stunning numbers
      these days, but the test car did weigh 3796 pounds. With its 18-pound carbon-fiber wheels and stickier Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, the R (at 3710 pounds) makes it to 60 in 3.9 seconds and through the quarter-mile in 12.2 seconds at 119 mph. Guess what?
      Porsche 911 GT3 drivers don’t jump up and down about drag-strip times. Stats that matter to them more are skidpad grip and braking distances. There, the 350 and 350R pull 0.98 g and a startling 1.10 g, while stopping from 70 mph in 152 feet and
      146 feet. Ford’s priorities become clear when you check the track-sheet data. In the grander scheme, this is part of the internationalization of Ford’s U.S. product line in general, from Fiestas to Transits. Today’s auto-industry economics demand
      that you play on a world stage, which in a sporty car means world-class dynamics. The Mustang can no longer be just an island of romantic longing for drag-strip Christmas trees and fluorescent-lit drive-ins. Okay, yes, the GT350 is North America–only
      for the time being, but its mien and manners are more BMW M4 than typical monster Mustang, even if the tire-shredding line-lock feature carries over into the Shelby. Really, the Cadillac ATS-V coupe, so enriched and able, is a better comparison
      to the GT350 than what seems to be its natural domestic competitor, the outgoing Chevrolet Camaro Z/28.
    </p>

    <p>Well, the Cad is a good comparison except for the Shelby’s oddly unique V-8. We’ve complained about turbo engines and their lack of character. You want an engine with character? The GT350’s “Voodoo” V-8 is Brad Pitt, the Terminator, and James Bond
      coming at you with matching wry grins. Everybody wants to know first what this 5.2-liter, 526-hp engine sounds like. Even when making its full 92-decibel war cry, it’s not a loping boom-boom like we’re used to from a muscle car, but rather a faster,
      more syncopated thrum that is more like what you hear from a Ferrari. Still, it doesn’t sound like a Ferrari, mainly because it doesn’t breathe like a Ferrari. In case you’ve missed our many prior memos on the subject, here is a highly condensed
      update: This is a slightly bored and stroked version of the Mustang GT’s 5.0-liter V-8 but with a flat-plane crankshaft, meaning the connecting-rod journals are 180-degrees out, like in a Ferrari 458 or a Ferrari California, rather than at 90-degree
      intervals as on almost every other V-8 in production. The Mustang does not wail like a Ferrari, however, because Ford’s engine is quite different. For one thing, it has a single intake and dual exhausts, as opposed to a dual intake and a single
      large muffler, as on a Ferrari. Also, rather than the Ferrari’s setup of, effectively, two four-cylinder engines joined at the crankshaft, where the center two pistons of each bank are 180 degrees out from the outer two, the Ford has a different
      arrangement. It puts each piston 180 out from the next one in line. This is mainly because Ford wanted a single large throttle body for better packaging and a power spread more befitting a Mustang. Ford Performance’s chief functional engineer, Kerry
      Baldori, standing trackside at Laguna and pausing to wait as each GT350 bellowed past, said the idea of a flat-plane crank happened after it was decided to replace the supercharged GT500 with a naturally aspirated V-8 in excess of 500 horsepower.
      Absent a blower, making that kind of sauce takes some tricks, especially if you’re sticking with port fuel injection. Ford engineers wanted to see why Ferrari is so enamored with flat cranks. They found out. A lighter, leaner crankshaft reduces
      windage losses and means faster windup. That, plus some heavy work on reducing internal friction, produced a Mustang V-8 that is the most esoteric (but also the most convincing) proof of Ford’s intentions to do this one right. No doubt, the resolve
      to go flat had an effect on decisions in other departments (“Well, if we’re going to do that, then we’d better give it good brakes,” etc.). The engineers combed the internet. Ford liked Brembo’s monoblock brake calipers but preferred exotic, radially
      pinned composite iron-aluminum rotors from a small German supplier called SHW. The R gets 19-inch carbon-fiber wheels from Australia’s Carbon Revolution, a tiny craft shop that was making its product in a pole barn before Ford Googled it. Getting
      small suppliers up to speed to meet rigorous original-equipment durability and quality benchmarks was a significant challenge for the program, says Baldori. The GT350R represents the first use of carbon-fiber wheels on a volume production car. In
      the suspension and tires, though, Ford went with some well-known quantities. Magnetorheological shocks (part of the $6500 Track package on the base 350 and included on the R) make the dampers highly reactive and flexible, giving the suspension engineers
      much wider latitude in the spring, shock, and anti-roll bar tuning. And Michelin’s best rubber was spec’d, including Michelin Pilot Super Sports for the 350 and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2s for the GT350R. (For more on the GT350 and GT350R’s impressive
      chassis, check out our deep dive.)
    </p>

    <p>The Mustang GT’s prodigious weight—just over 3800 pounds—was shaved from various locations, including from the engine, the lighter aluminum front knuckles, and a wholesale transmission swap. The GT350’s Tremec 3160 six-speed manual, the only transmission
      offered, knocks a few pounds off the heavier Getrag MT82 six-speed in the Mustang GT while delivering quicker shifts. (As we already noted, the GT350R tipped our scales at 3710 pounds, while the GT350 with the Track pack weighted 3796 pounds.) During
      our single day of driving on the Monterey Peninsula, we weren’t able to experience the base GT350. All of them had Track packs or were Rs. Unlike Shelbys of yore, the new GT350 on its optional magnetic dampers swallows the road much better, leaving
      contact lenses and dentures in place. The transmission has short throws and an easy precision, and the clutch pedal’s relative lightness means the GT350 can be an everyday elixir if you want. Those of you already accustomed to the sudden, explosive
      shove of modern turbo engines must turn back your clocks a bit. The big V-8 isn’t peaky, but neither will it pull a stump at 1500 rpm. The torque curve apogees at 4750 rpm, a lofty number in these pressurized days. However, the Voodoo is more about
      the journey than the destination. The spin-up is an even and incredibly long crescendo of aural violence, with the real liftoff happening at 3500 rpm when the engine comes into its wind.
    </p>

    <p>From there it goes. And goes. And goes. You never seem to run out of revs. On a track, that means less shifting, which means quicker lap times. Only a long-legged BMW, or maybe a turbo-free Lamborghini, offers a similar experience. This is the way
      performance engines used to be, not as all-or-nothing boost bombs but as measured and controlled rheostats. We are likely witnessing the final opus of the naturally aspirated V-8. Even Ferrari has given up on it, simply because they suck gas. We
      averaged 15 mpg with the regular 350 and 14 mpg with the R, below their EPA-rated combined figures of 16 mpg. Well, honors to Ford for ushering out an era with a magnificent finale. We said no-excuses earlier, but there are a few. Ford’s own version
      of the Michelin Pilot Super Sports is slightly conservative, with smaller blocks and plenty of siping. Clearly, as with the Germans who use similar versions of the Super Sport, Ford wants some wet-weather capability. The trade-off is some understeer
      when the GT350 is pushed. Worse, the same dull steering rack as in more menial Mustangs carries over, here with a leisurely 16.5:1 ratio. The electric booster has revised software maps for its three driver-selectable modes, which are even different
      from GT350 to GT350R, but coding alone can’t cure this mass-market system of its confidence-sapping numbness. No doubt, this is the first component the engineers would use a blank check to change.
    </p>

    <p>Move up to the GT350R with its tackier tires and the understeer diminishes. Ford claims more downforce for this model than a Porsche 911 GT3. It’s impossible to verify, but the R is riveted to the asphalt, its suspension digesting the various yumps
      and curbs of Laguna with an unflappable equilibrium while you are held fast in the deeply bolstered buckets. The brake pedal stayed firm and potent for us, but we were given only a few consecutive laps to warm it. And under orders from Ford’s trackside
      safety mavens, we could run the car only with its stability control in the Track mode, not fully off. The system mostly stayed out of the picture, only coming in to modulate the throttle on the loose, bumpy Corkscrew. We’ll get a better track test
      of the GT350R at our next Lightning Lap. Meanwhile, about 4000 or so GT350s and a much smaller number of Rs will go to dealers on an annual basis. Prepare for hefty markups. Except for that, this new Shelby isn’t like any of its predecessors. The
      muscle car is finally moving on.

    <h2>GOING DEEPER: GT350 vs. GT350R</h2>

    <p>Go for the base $49,995 Shelby GT350 and you get the mega motor and wide-body front fenders to go with it, plus the redesigned Recaro seats, Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires on 19-inch aluminum wheels, and a sportier suspension tune than the regular
      Mustang GT. The tires are 295/35 in front and 305/35 in back. The $6500 Track pack brings the magnetic suspension, a front shock-tower brace, firmer springs, and oil coolers for the engine, transmission, and rear differential. Or a separate $7500
      Technology package buys most of the Track pack content plus some comfort items such as auto climate control, navigation, and heated and cooled leather seats. The R package adds $13,500 to the base price and includes the Track package plus a carbon-fiber
      wing and wheels, which weigh a mere 18 pounds apiece, and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, colossally sized 305/30 in front and 315/30 in back. The R also moves around some interior switches and dispenses with the back seats, the radio, air conditioning,
      and the backup camera, most of which you can add back in with a $3000 Electronics package. Check every box, including the painted black roof ($695), the one extracost paint (yellow, $495), “over the top” racing stripes ($475), and the special car
      cover ($375), and you’re at $68,535.
    </p>

    <p>Thus, the absolutely loaded GT350R is just $2140 more than the stripper price of a BMW M4, and about $4900 more than the base price of the Cadillac ATS-V coupe. It’s also about $6500 less than the old Z/28. At the GT350’s launch, Ford harped on the
      car’s value. Considering how different it is from the regular $33,200 Mustang GT, it has a case.</p>
